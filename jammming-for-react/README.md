## Search Tracks Feature

### The Objective

The goal for this project is to develop a feature which allows Spotify users to search song tracks from Spotifyâ€™s API and presents a track list based on the input for search.

### Requirements/Background

If users need to create and save their own playlist to their Spotify profile, there needs to be a feature to search songs by user input and the use of the API. Using the documentation on the Spotify API calls with code snippets, I implemented the following tasks for the feature:
-	Allow the value of the search bar to update every letter typed by the user as input.
-	Execute lines of code to begin GET request API call when the user clicks the search button.
-	Execute GET request API call to retrieve all the song tracks based on input value.
